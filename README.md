# ScreamingBetaWars
Crappy remake of ScreamingBedWars, but for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3.

### Description

**Plugin made as a joke for April Fools, not meant for actual use.**

Like really, don't use it, at least this branch.

### Why shouldn't I use it?

Well, quite a list:

- This plugin abuses ram, disk usage, and cpu.
- Current bugs are causing spam in the console, AsyncRepeatingTask is causing huge lags and (most likely) ram leaks.
- It doesn't fully work, some parts don't even work and cause errors.
- Code is unorganized, SnakeYaml usage doesn't help.

### NOTE:

This branch is an **original branch** - that means untouched code, just like it was at the release time.

You want to see changes? [Wrong branch then](https://github.com/LortServers/ScreamingBetaWars/).

### Plugin doesn't work.
Well, like I said previously, it's for Beta 1.7.3. If you want to code, you have to add original CraftBukkit Beta 1.7.3 JAR as a library. If you want to test this plugin, you have to use that JAR as your server. Can't find the JAR? It's [here](https://archive.org/details/BukkitMCBeta173).

Alternatively for newer versions, you can try to replace deprecated functions, and it should work as well.

**Note that project was made using Java 8, and may not work on Java 7.**

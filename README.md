# ScreamingBetaWars
Crappy remake of ScreamingBedWars, but for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3.

### Description

**Plugin made as a joke for April Fools, not meant for actual use.**
Like really, don't use it, at least now.

### Why shouldn't I use it?

Well, quite a list:
- This plugin abuses ram, disk usage, and cpu.
- Current bugs spam in the console, AsyncRepeatingTask is causing huge lags and (most likely) ram leaks.
- It doesn't fully work, some parts don't even work and cause errors.
- Code is unorganized, SnakeYaml usage doesn't help.

### So what now?

I will try to continue working on it until it's actually done, and will not cause further problems.
After it's done, I will no longer push updates unless there will be some interest for it.

# ScreamingBetaWars
Crappy remake of ScreamingBedWars, but for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3.

### Description

**Plugin made as a joke for April Fools, not meant for actual use.**

Like really, don't use it, at least now.

### Why shouldn't I use it?

Well, quite a list:

- This plugin abuses ram, disk usage, and cpu.
- Current bugs are causing spam in the console, AsyncRepeatingTask is causing huge lags and (most likely) ram leaks.
- It doesn't fully work, some parts don't even work and cause errors.
- Code is unorganized, SnakeYaml usage doesn't help.

**I will keep on updating this list until whole list will be ~~striked~~.**

### So what now?

I will try to continue working on it until it's actually done, and will not cause further problems.

After it's done, I will no longer push updates unless there will be some interest for it.

### Plugin doesn't work.
Well, like I said previously, it's for Beta 1.7.3. If you want to code, you have to add original CraftBukkit Beta 1.7.3 JAR as a library. If you want to test this plugin, you have to use that JAR as your server. Can't find the JAR? It's [here](https://archive.org/details/BukkitMCBeta173).

Alternatively for newer versions, you can try to replace deprecated functions, and it should work as well.

**Note that project was made using Java 8, and may not work on Java 7.**
